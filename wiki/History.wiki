#summary The history of Origin

Origin was started at Kent State University by Andrew Sutton as part of a project to rewrite the [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html Boost Graph Library] sometime in 2008 using the C++0x programming language. This was an offshoot from a [http://code.google.com/soc/ Google Summer of Code] project. The primary emphasis of the project involved (and still involves) experimenting with the designs that would make the library easier to use.

Andrew recruited several undergraduates who were interested in learning advanced C++ programming, and started expanding the scope of Origin. Students worked on C++0x projects including graph data structures, memory layout, trees, hashing and binning, template metaprogramming, concept checking and emulation. Michael Lopez is still working on the Origin.Graph library.

The original work on Origin is still hosted at Kent State University, [http://calder.sdml.cs.kent.edu/trac/origin here].

In January of 2011, he moved the hosting of Origin form Kent State to Google, making it available under the MIT License.
