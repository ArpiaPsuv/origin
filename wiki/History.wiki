#summary The history of Origin

Origin was started at Kent State University by Andrew Sutton as part of a project to rewrite the [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html Boost Graph Library] sometime in 2008 using the C++0x programming language. This was an offshoot from a [http://code.google.com/soc/ Google Summer of Code] project. The primary emphasis of the project involved (and still involves) experimenting with the designs that would make the library easier to use.

The name "Origin" was actually a name that Andrew proposed as the name of the KDE development libraries when KDE 4.0 was first being developed and released and had several new components with neat names (e.g., Plasma, Phonon, etc.). The word "origin" means (roughly) "a beginning", and is a synonym for "source" (as in code). KDE didn't want the name, so Andrew kept it.

Andrew recruited several undergraduates who were interested in learning advanced C++ programming, and started expanding the scope of Origin. Students worked on C++0x projects including graph data structures, memory layout, trees, hashing and binning, template metaprogramming, concept checking and emulation. Michael Lopez, now a PhD student at Texas A&M, is still working on the Origin Graph library.

In 2010, Andrew moved to Texas A&M where he accepted a position as a postdoctoral researcher with Bjarne Stroustrup, where Origin has become a central part of his research. In particular, he used C++11 to help experiment with different designs for concepts for the STL. His longterm goal for Origin is to provide generic libraries for numeric and scientific computing.
