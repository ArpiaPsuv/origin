#summary Project ideas

The following is a list of project ideas for Origin C++ libraries. The goal
of these pages is to provide some initial requirements for C++ library 
projects. My goal is to enumerate basic requirements for each project and
document some design and implementation considerations that I feel are
important.

This list is a work in progress.

 * [Ideas_PrefixTree Prefix tree]
 * [Ideas_SuffixTree Suffix tree]
 * [Ideas_SuffixArray Suffix array]

== Linear algebra ==
